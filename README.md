# NET.Undersoft.Sdk.Research
Release version of an independent SDK supporting programming with the use of just in time (JIT) aka runtime compilation to create frameworks for modern distributed systems, including cloud-based systems. AKKA and Ms Orleans technologies are characterized by a similar philosophy. The library contains solutions different from the standard SDK, approaches and algorithms for handling basic areas such as collections (data structures), threads, network communication, etc.
