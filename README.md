Research version of Virtual Environment Graph As Structure (VEGAS) Software Development Kit dedicated for fast processing of data structures in real time. Contains cache and file system storage using memory mapped files. Supports programming using just in time (JIT) aka runtime compilation to create data driven frameworks for distributed systems, including cloud-based solutions. The library offers algorithms slightly different than those included in the standard SDK. Also approach to handling basic areas such as collections (data structures), threads, network communication, linear math operations on collections and many others has been changed.
